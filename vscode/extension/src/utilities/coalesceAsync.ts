/**
 * Serialize an async task so it never overlaps with itself, collapsing any
 * calls that arrive while it is running into a single rerun.
 *
 * Restarting the language server means stopping a client and starting another.
 * Letting two of those interleave leaves commands registered by the outgoing
 * client colliding with the incoming one, and leaves requests addressed to a
 * client that has already been disposed. Queueing one run per trigger would
 * only spread the same problem out over time, so queued triggers collapse into
 * one rerun: all the caller wants is for the task to have run after its
 * request, not for it to run once per request.
 *
 * @param task The task to serialize.
 * @returns A function that resolves once the task has run for that call.
